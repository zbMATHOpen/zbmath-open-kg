# zbMATH Open Knowledge Graph
## Overview

The zbMATH Open Knowledge Graph (KG) is a large-scale RDF knowledge graph constructed from the zbMATH Open platform. Its combination of temporal depth spanning over centuries of mathematical scholarship and expert-curated domain-specific contents provides an open semantic infrastructure for studying the development of mathematical knowledge and tracing scholarly connections across centuries of scholarship. 

To support interoperability, the knowledge graph is constructed using established Semantic Web vocabularies and ontologies and designed to align with FAIR principles. 

**Update**: The zbMATH Open Knowledge Graph has been updated; this description reflects the changes and features introduced in the latest version. For previous version, see [v01](./v01/).

## Ontology and Metadata Descriptions

We provides machine-readable ontology and dataset metadata descriptions for zbMATH Open KG:

- [zbMATH Open Ontology (OWL)](./data/v01/zbmath-kg-ontology.ttl)
- [DCAT + VoID + PROV-O Description](./data/zbmath-kg-dcat-void-prov.ttl) — A DCAT + VoID dataset metadata file with PROV-O provenance and full ETL pipeline documentation

## Key Statistics

The following statistics are reported as of July 2026. The current KG was constructed using the January 2026 [zbMATH API](https://oai.zbmath.org/) data dump.

- **Temporal Span**: 1763~2025.
  - See [`decade aggregation count`](./src/retrieval-tasks/decade-aggregation-count.csv) for the per-year distribution.
  - Although the dataset includes some records from earlier years, its coverage is only complete from 1868 to the present day, according to [zbmath.org](https://zbmath.org/about/). 
- **Triples**: 168M+
- **Distinct Entities**: 34M+
- **Publications**: 4M+
- **Structured identifiers (zbMATH ID, DOI)**: 4M+
- **Disambiguated Person (Authors & Reviewers)**: 1M+
- _(expert-curated)_ **Reviews**: 3M+
- _(expert-curated)_ **Subject classifications (MSC)**: 6.7K+
- _(expert-curated)_ **Keywords**: 3M+
- _(expert-curated)_ **Software records**: 30K+
- **Organizations/Publishers**: 3.5K+
- **Periodicals**: 7.3K+ ... (and more)

## Key Features

- **RDF-Based Knowledge Graph**  
  Compliant with RDF and Semantic Web standards, the zbMATH Open KG is built entirely from RDF triples using widely adopted ontologies and vocabularies (e.g., ``schema:, dcterms:, skos:, cito:``), supporting interoperability and adheres to Linked Open Data principles. The full RDF dumps is published on [**Zenodo**](http://zenodo). A sample of 200 records is available here: [`data/subset-200.ttl`](./data/subset-200-v2.ttl). 

- **Expert-Curated, High-Quality Mathematical Metadata**  
  In addition to standard bibliographic metadata, the KG incorporates annotated mathematical publications with expert-curated reviews and controlled keywords, software references, disambiguated authors, and *Mathematics Subject Classification* (MSC) codes -- a fine-grained ontology for mathematical subject classification.

- **Historically-Grounded Scholarly Discovery and Exploration**  
  Its comprehensive and long-term coverage enable long-range intellectual analysis such as historically-grounded retrieval tasks e.g., identifying connections beyond citation and tracing conceptual lineages across (_sub_)disciplines.

- **SPARQL Query Interface**  
  A SPARQL endpoint (temporarily at [**SPARQL endpoint url**](http://212.227.170.235:8890/sparql)) for directly executing queries over the KG.
  
- **Linked Data Integration**  
URI resolution for core entities (i.e., publications, scholars, software references). Cross-links with external URLs and persistent identifiers (e.g., DOI). 
  
## Construction and Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+  
- Python libraries: `rdflib`, `SPARQLWrapper`, and others (see requirements.txt)  
- Java 8 or higher (required only if you run Apache Jena libraries outside Docker)  
- Docker (for running RDF triple stores like Apache Jena Fuseki without manual Java setup)  
  - We use [Apache Jena Fuseki](https://jena.apache.org/documentation/fuseki2/) as an example for its simplicity  
  - *Note:* Production SPARQL endpoints use Virtuoso (See the [`zb-virtuoso`](./zb-virtuoso) directory for the complete Virtuoso setup.)

### Data Harvesting

To harvest data by zbMATH ID (e.g., ID list of zbMATH open access subset: [zbMATH OA subset](https://zenodo.org/records/8021789)), run:

```bash
python src/harvest-by-id.py 
```

For bulk download (via _sickle_), refers to: [zbMATHOpen Harvester](https://github.com/zbMATHOpen/mscHarvester)

### RDF Construction

Using raw `.jsonl` zbMATH data obtained from the API (see example: [`data/subset-200.jsonl`](./data/subset-200.jsonl)), run the following commands to automatically generate the RDF KG:

```bash
# Option 1: Run the Python script
python src/create-rdf-v2.py --inp data/subset-200.jsonl --out data/subset-200.ttl --nt 0

# Option 2: Run the shell script for batch processing
run-convert.sh

```

### RDF Triple Store Setup

We provide example using [Apache Jena Fuseki](https://jena.apache.org/documentation/fuseki2/) as the RDF triple store for the KG. Fuseki provides a lightweight SPARQL server to host and query your knowledge graph. The example setup is provided in [`front/`](./front). 

We provide a sample subset of the zbMATH Open KG data you can use here: [`data/subset-200.ttl`](./data/subset-200-v2.ttl). Before running the example, ensure this initial data file is located in the same folder as the `docker-compose.yml` file. If not, update the volume mapping in [`front/docker-compose.yml`](./front/docker-compose.yml) accordingly:

```yaml
- ./subset-200-v2.ttl:/data.ttl
```

Then, start the service by running:
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This will launch Fuseki on port 3030 and load the initial data via [`fuseki-entrypoint.sh`](front/fuseki-entrypoint.sh).

Your SPARQL endpoint URL will be available at: `http://localhost:3030/dataset/sparql`

For Virtuoso setup, see the [`zb-virtuoso`](./zb-virtuoso) directory.

## Contact and Maintenance:

The construction process is designed as a reproducible pipeline over the continuously maintained zbMATH Open platform. The knowledge graph is planned to be updated periodically, approximately twice per year subject to the availability of the underlying data stream, resource and infrastructure constraint.
